### Day 0:

**Today's Progress**: Unarchived the github repo for the challenge, reset the log.

**Thoughts:** Re-commiting to the challenge. It just makes sense now since I know I need to practice the stuff I'm learning in order for it to "stick."

### Day 1 - August 18, 2019:

**Today's Progress**:
Completed Basic Javascript challenges up through [Word Blanks](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/word-blanks)

**Thoughts:**
Just making sure to reinforce the basics before the challenges ramp up.

### Day 2 - August 19, 2019:

**Today's Progress**:
Completed Basic Javascript challenges up to [Comparison with the Greater Than Operator](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/comparison-with-the-greater-than-operator)

**Thoughts:**
Neat the .unshift can push a value onto the _front_ of an array. :)

### Day 3 - August 20, 2019:

**Today's Progress**:
Completed Basic Javascript challenges up to [Basic JavaScript: Using Objects for Lookups](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/using-objects-for-lookups)
**Thoughts:**
Object properties instead of a switch statement? Interesting.

### Day 4 - August 21, 2019:

**Today's Progress**:
Completed the [Basic JavaScript: Record Collection](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/record-collection) challenge.

**Thoughts:**
Probably a bit messy in the if-else department.

**Link to work:**

### Day 5 - August 24, 2019:

**Today's Progress**:
Finished the basic Javascript challenges. On to [ES6 challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6)!

**Thoughts:**
Ternary operator is fun! :D

**Link to work:**

### Day 6 - August 25, 2019:

**Today's Progress**:
Finished the ES6 challenges. On to [Introduction to the Regular Expression Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/regular-expressions).

**Thoughts:**
These seem to be everywhere in programming. :D

**Link to work:**

### Day 7 - August 27, 2019:

**Today's Progress**:
Completed the RegEx challenges. Next up: [Debugging](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/debugging)!

**Thoughts:**
Sometimes, the wording of the challenges can be a bit ambiguous. I suppose that's preparation for real life. :)

### Day 8-9 - August 29, 2019:

**Today's Progress**:
Finished the Debugging, Basic Data Structures, Algorithms, and OOP challenges. Partially through Functional Programming.
<https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/functional-programming>
**Thoughts:**
Did the work, forgot to post.

### Day 10-12 - September 1, 2019:

**Today's Progress**:
Fell into a bit of a rabbit hole at CodinGame. Managed (so far) to reach level 4 (bronze league scrub.)

**Thoughts:**
This AI stuff is kind of tough. Going to have to find more info on it.

### Day 13 - September 4, 2019:

**Today's Progress**:
Got a few more functional programming challenges done, through [Use the reduce Method to Analyze Data](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/functional-programming/use-the-reduce-method-to-analyze-data)

**Thoughts:**
Apparently, reduce() can do some stuff that filter() and map() can't, for more general array processing. We'll see.

### Day 14 - September 5, 2019:

**Today's Progress**:
Finished the functional programming challenges. Huzzah!

**Thoughts:**
Got a bit stuck on "Sort an Array Alphabetically using the sort Method" since Chrome seems to have a different version of sort that treats characters differently(?) That was not so fun. Had to search the FreeCodeCamp forums to find that out. The "hint" had it wrong too - using the solution code failed in Chrome, in case it's unclear. That means perfectly valid JS code may not work properly in Chrome(ironically).

Currying is defintely a concept I haven't seen until I started learning Javascript.

### Day 15 - September 6, 2019:

**Today's Progress**:
Completed a couple algorithm challenges, including [Seek and Destroy](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/seek-and-destroy).

**Thoughts:**
Something fun to do is to check out other solutions for the same problem. Sometimes, the "advanced" solution can be a bit more readable (or less, if it's a bit too clever.)

### Day 16 - September 8, 2019:

**Today's Progress**:
Completed [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Wherefore art thou](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/wherefore-art-thou)

**Thoughts:**
Remembering that filter can be used instead of convoluted loops with many ifs is tricky!

### Day 17 - September 9, 2019:

**Today's Progress**:
Completed [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Spinal Tap Case](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/spinal-tap-case)
**Thoughts:**
I feel like regular expressions are the true arcane arts of programming.
