##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: Jan 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Gone through a several more exercises on FreeCodeCamp after a long hiatus.

**Thoughts** I've recently found an unusual game, Screeps, which bases it controls on Javascript code. All action there's controlled by code, so I want to learn well enough to pick up the ability to create my own scripts to control the game, and perhaps to someday become a serious player. Before that, I need to really think in Javascript.

### Day 2: Jan 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: A few more jQuery tutorial challenges, leading to the first project

**Thoughts**: Learned the importance of using 'target="_blank'" to force CodePen to open the links in a new tab. Started the tribute page project. Selected a subject (Nolan Bushnell) and began building the page, using online reference material.

### Day 3: Jan 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: All the content of the tribute page is in place. Still need to make the formatting happen

**Thoughts**: Copy-paste of elements gets tedious (long list items, for example). Tried using some basic text editors geared towards HTML.

### Day 4: Jan 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Layout's done! Page is done! :)

**Thoughts**: Became more familiar with Bootstrap for layout. It's nice not to have to have to write any CSS separately to get a decent layout.

### Day 5: Jan 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Change of plans to jump into algorithm challenges after a bit of Javascript OO and functional programming brush-up.

**Thoughts**: Will dig into these challenges to get the problem-solving neurons firing properly.

### Day 7: Jan 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed palindrome challenge.

**Thoughts**: There's a few things needing remembering for JS, such as chaining, and array indexing shortcuts, and regex syntax needed a refresher too. :|
